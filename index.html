          <p>I'm an aspiring data analyst living in Dallas, Texas.</p>

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Being highly organized and attention to detail keeps me highly
              prudent
            </li>
            <li>
              Creating a spreadsheet that allowed multiple offices to view the
              status of their cases/restorations
            </li>

        <h2 class="text-centered">About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Formerly I work as dental lab technicain for a family-owned dental
          offce that has locations across Dallas-Fort Worth. I work with the
          dentists and dental assistants to ensure the patient is highly
          satisfied with their new smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm excited to work with like-minded people and discovering a story
          from data!
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, I enjoy hiking and venturing the great outdoors,
          traveling to locations that have breathtaking views that have a little
          more elevation changes that you see in Texas, or Florida where I'm
          originally from. I also enjoy going to music festivals and expanding
          my music pallate!
